# Assingment 2

Version control is a software that allows the seamless tracking of code changes and allows multiple users to manipulate code simultaneously.

This assignment was difficult but rewarding for me because:
- Most of the terminology is foreign to me
- It is challenging jumping from Atom to Github app, and then the web Version
-  Seeing the finished project makes all of this worth it.

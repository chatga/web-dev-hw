# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Martel Reum
I decided to take this class because I needed to fill my electives for my social work degree.  I am still uncertain if this class is going to be manageable for me as I do not have a background in coding.

But what really is the internet?  I was amazed to learn that:
*  I was unaware of the date of inception for the internet.
* It is amazing how the internet spawned from a department of defense idea.
* I always thought that the World Wide Web and the Internet were the same thing.

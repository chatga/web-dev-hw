    <h1>Blame It On the Rain Lyrics</h1>
      <p>
          [Verse 1]
    <br />
    You said you didn't need her
    <br />
    You told her good-bye
    <br />
    You sacrificed a good love
    <br />
    To satisfy your pride
    <br />
    Now you wished that you should have her
    <br />
    And you feel like such a fool
    <br />
    You let her walk away
    <br />
    Now it just don't feel the same
    </br />
    Gotta blame it on something
    <br />
    Gotta blame it on something
    <br />

                [Chorus]
    <br />
    Blame it on the rain that was falling, falling
    <br />
    Blame it on the stars that shine at night
    <br />
    Whatever you do
    <br />
    Don't put the blame on you
    <br />
    Blame it on the rain, yeah-yeah
    <br />
    You can blame it on the rain
    <br />

              [Verse 2]
    <br />
    Should've told her you were sorry
    <br />
    Could have said you were wrong
    <br />
    But no you couldn't do that
    <br />
    You had to prove you were strong
    <br />
    If you hadn't been so blinded
    <br />
    She might still be there with you
    <br />
    You want her back again
    <br />
    But she just don't feel the same
    <br />
    Gotta blame it on something
    <br />
    Gotta blame it on something
    <br />
